# Anime Higher or Lower Game (Anime List Version)
Insipred by other anime higher or lower games, this project takes the same idea but instead bases off user anime list scores instead of regular score, popularity, etc.

## How it works
Tech Used: React, MAL api, Bootstrap
MAL api used to fetch user lists, react for backend, bootstrap for front end

## Usage
- User inputs MAL username, selects game mode (scored or endless), selects # of rounds (if mode is scored)
- MAL api called to fetch all necessary information
- Standard HOL gameplay. If gamemode is scored, play until specified number or rounds. If gamemode is endless, play until get one wrong
- Game over screen shows final score and back/play again

## Potential Issues
If I decide to release this there may be some api request related issues but that's a problem for future me
